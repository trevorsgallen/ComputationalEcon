\textbf{Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item You should have a word/\LaTeX document that has three sections: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Discusses the model and answers the questions I pose throughout.
\item Contains the tables and figures you will produce.
\item Contains a discussion of your programming choices if you had to make any.
\end{enumerate}
\item You should have a Matlab file or set of files (zipped) that contain \textbf{all} your programs and raw data.  There should be a file called ``Main.M" that produces everything I need in one click.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model}
Take the model from Homework 2, repeated here for convenience, with slightly different  parts, highlighted in {\color{red}{red}}:
Households have Stone-Geary utility over consumption $c_t$:
$$u(c_t,L_t)=\sqrt(c_t-1)$$
Their income each period is the sum of permanent income $P_t$ and a transitory shock $\epsilon_t$:
$$ Y_t=P_t+\epsilon_t$$
Where:
$$\epsilon_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)$$
Permanent income is a random walk:
$$P_t=P_{t-1}+\zeta_t$$
Where:
$$\zeta_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\zeta)$$
Households face the budget constraint:
$$Y_t+(1+r)s_{t-1}=c_t+s_t$$
And the borrowing constraint:  $s_t\geq \overline{s}$.\\

Households maximize the net present value of utility, discounted at a rate $0<{\color{red}{\beta}}<1$. Assume that households live until period $T$.\\

Now, let the following numerical assumptions hold:

Concept & Parameter & Value \\ 
Lifespan & T & 45 \\

Borrowing constraint & $\overline{s}$ & -0.2 \\
Initial permanent income:  & $P_0$ & 5\\
Variance of permanent income shock:  & $\sigma^2_\zeta$ & 0.02\\
Variance of transitory income shock:  & $\sigma^2_\epsilon$ & 0.04\\
Interest rates:  & $r_{t}$ & 0.05\\
Initial savings:  & $s_{0}$ & $\sim\mathcal{N}(0,$\textcolor{red}{???})\\

\textbf{Question 1:}   Your goal is to calibrate this structural model by finding {\textcolor{red}{$\beta$}} and {\textcolor{red}{$\sigma^2_\zeta$}}  such that, in expectation:
$$mean(\log(c_{30}^{sim})/\log(c_{29}^{sim}))=1.001788$$
$$Var((s_2^{sim})))=0.00409$$

To do so, you need to have an estimating ``outer loop" and a value-function solving and simulating ``inner loop."  Homework 2 created a file that 1) solved household models and (2) simulated households \emph{given}  $\beta$ and $\sigma^2_{s_0}$.  Your goal is to now (1) create a ``wrapper" function that \emph{takes}  $\beta$ and $\sigma^2_{s_0}$and spits out (for instance) the squared sum of difference between your simulated result and your target result, and chooses  $\beta$ and $\sigma^2_{s_0}$ to minimize that sum of squared errors.\\

This is the core of simulated method of moments/``calibration."
