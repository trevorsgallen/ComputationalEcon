# ComputationalEcon
A repository for Purdue Ph.D. Computational Economics Materials 

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide easy access to the materials for Purdue's Ph.D.-level Computational Economics Course.  This repository is primarily in MATLAB, a proprietary software produced by MathWorks.  

The course is split up into two halves:
1. MATLAB and General Scientific Computing
     1. MATLAB Syntax
     2. Numerical Derivatives
     3. Root-finding
     4. Minimization/Maximization (derivative-based and derivative-free, local and global)
     5. Integration/Quadrature
     6. Bellman Equations (basic theory)
2.  Applied Computational Economics
     1. General Computational Equilibrium Models
     2. Numerical Solving of Bellman Equations
     3. Structural Estimation
     
Most of the applied examples in this course are generated using examples from Trade, Public, Macro, and Labor economics.
